# 30x Inventory-Aligned Operating Plan

## Outcome

Make the CRM feel like each user owns their work, while the system manages the routing underneath:

- Every pasted lead is instantly matched to available inventory in the requested area.
- Inventory must come from Supply Hub PG data only; no random property creation for matching.
- Every Flow Ops person gets a different area/goal board.
- Every TCM gets a different tour-closing board based on their zone and assigned supply.
- HR sees whether Flow Ops, TCMs, and Owners are producing results.
- Owners see how their inventory is being used to create tours and bookings.
- Use the word “Tours” everywhere, not “Visits”.

Core operating loop:

```text
Lead paste → parse → duplicate check → area demand → inventory match → Flow Ops schedules Tour → TCM closes Tour → HR monitors → Owner supplies rooms
```

## 1. Inventory-first Quick Add

Upgrade Quick Add so it does not just parse a lead; it immediately answers:

- Which area did this lead ask for?
- Which inventory is available in that area?
- Which property should be pitched first?
- Which Flow Ops owner should work this lead?
- Which TCM should take the Tour if scheduled?
- What is the next action?

Inside `QuickAddLeadPanel`:

- Keep paste-first zero-click parsing.
- Quick Add is the single paste flow; copied lead data must sync into the QuickAD question set, not a separate Paste Lead flow.
- Quick Add and Schedule Tour must reuse the same questions: name, phone, email, areas, full address/map link, budget, move-in, type, room, need, special requests, and in-BLR.
- After parsing, show an “Area Inventory Fit” block above the form:
  - requested areas
  - matching properties
  - available beds/rooms
  - price fit against budget
  - gender/room fit
  - distance/commute estimate where known
  - best property to pitch
- Add a one-click “Schedule Tour with best property” action.
- If duplicate found, show only one decision point:
  - “Use existing lead and schedule Tour”
  - no phone refill, no repeated questions.
- Existing lead → Tour must carry the stored lead plus the fresh parsed QuickAD answers into Schedule Tour.

## 2. Area-personalized Flow Ops boards

Flow Ops goal: schedule Tours.

Each Flow Ops person should see a different board based on their assigned zone/area and available inventory.

Add/upgrade Flow Ops page with:

- My Area Goal: “Schedule X Tours today in Koramangala/HSR/etc.”
- Area inventory pressure:
  - hot areas with vacant beds
  - cold areas needing demand
  - properties with rooms available now
- Lead-to-inventory queue:
  - leads grouped by requested area
  - best matching property beside each lead
  - single “Schedule Tour” action
- Flow Ops scoreboard:
  - leads parsed
  - qualified leads
  - Tours scheduled
  - same-day Tours
  - inventory covered

Example behavior:

```text
Flow Ops A: Koramangala leads + Koramangala inventory + Koramangala TCMs
Flow Ops B: HSR leads + HSR inventory + HSR TCMs
Flow Ops C: Whitefield leads + Whitefield inventory + Whitefield TCMs
Flow Ops D: BTM/Electronic City leads + matching supply
```

## 3. Area-personalized TCM boards

TCM goal: close every scheduled Tour.

Each TCM should see a board tied to their own zone, properties, and scheduled Tours.

Upgrade TCM dashboard with:

- My Tours today, sorted by hard/medium/soft intent.
- Property win cards:
  - why this property fits the lead
  - available room type
  - price fit
  - objections likely to come up
  - closing script
- “Close this Tour” checklist:
  - confirm arrival
  - show best room
  - handle objection
  - mark outcome
  - book/token/follow-up
- TCM target:
  - Tours assigned
  - show-ups
  - closures
  - lost reasons by property/area

This makes TCMs feel they own a territory and outcome, not just a list.

## 4. HR command layer

HR goal: ensure Flow Ops and TCMs are working together.

Upgrade HR/War Room with:

- Area-by-area operating table:
  - leads available
  - inventory available
  - Tours scheduled
  - TCM capacity
  - bookings
  - leak stage
- People performance by role:
  - Flow Ops: scheduled Tours vs goal
  - TCM: closure/show-up vs goal
  - Owner: inventory freshness and approval speed
- “Where to push today” recommendations:
  - area with supply but not enough leads
  - area with demand but no tours
  - TCM overloaded
  - property owner blocking inventory
- Clear command actions:
  - reassign leads
  - push Flow Ops to schedule
  - push TCM to close
  - ask owner for inventory/photos/price approval

## 5. Owner inventory cockpit

Owner goal: give inventory to the team so everyone can produce results.

Update owner pages so owners see:

- My available rooms/beds.
- Which leads are asking for my area/property.
- How many Tours were scheduled from my inventory.
- What the team needs from me:
  - approve room block
  - update price
  - add photos
  - confirm room availability
- “Managed by Gharpayy” confidence layer:
  - owner feels they own the inventory
  - team visibly manages demand, Tours, and closure.

Also rename owner “Visits” navigation/page wording to “Tours”.

## 6. Pipeline feature

Add a clear pipeline view so nobody loses where the lead is.

Pipeline stages:

```text
New Lead → Parsed → Qualified → Inventory Matched → Options Shared → Tour Scheduled → Tour Done → Booked / Follow-up / Lost
```

Pipeline should support filters by:

- area
- Flow Ops person
- TCM
- property
- lead age
- inventory fit
- duplicate status

This becomes the shared truth for all four roles.

## 7. Geo-intelligence tied to inventory

Implement the Geo-intelligence tab as an operational tool, not just a display.

For every parsed lead:

- pull parsed location
- pull map links
- detect areas/landmarks
- use Supply Hub PG coordinates, area centroids, and matcher distances for lead distance
- show “distance from lead location to matched inventory”
- show “distance from there to here” for common travel/area comparison
- show confidence:
  - high: map link or known landmark
  - medium: recognized area
  - low: vague/free-text location
- show recommended action:
  - pitch exact area
  - pitch nearby area
  - ask for map pin
  - skip if supply mismatch

## 8. Result-linked Coach

Upgrade Coach so it gives goals, not generic tips.

Coach examples:

- Flow Ops: “You are 3 Tours behind in HSR. These 5 leads match available beds. Schedule now.”
- TCM: “You have 2 hard Tours at Koramangala. Pitch these rooms first; price fit is strong.”
- HR: “Whitefield has 12 available beds but only 2 Tours scheduled. Push Flow Ops.”
- Owner: “Your room has demand but no fresh photos. Upload/approve to unlock more Tours.”

Coach must use supply, inventory, Tours, bookings, and people performance.

## 8A. 15x ownership-mode experience

Make each role feel like they own their area, people, and outcomes while the system manages routing, matching, capacity, and reminders underneath.

- Flow Ops owns: area goal, matched lead queue, best property pitch, and one-click Tour scheduling.
- TCM owns: today's assigned Tours, property win cards, show-up control, objection handling, and closing checklist.
- HR owns: area operating table, role performance, leaks, overloads, and command actions.
- Property Owner owns: room readiness, pricing/photos/availability approvals, and demand generated from their inventory.
- System manages: duplicate linking, inventory fit, TCM capacity, property recommendation, room blocks, result-linked Coach nudges, and pipeline movement.

The UI should avoid making users repeat data already known by the system. Existing leads must move straight to Tour scheduling with one decision point.

## 9. Four-persona testing requirement

Test the module as at least four personas for each role.

Flow Ops personas:

1. High-volume WhatsApp scheduler.
2. New Flow Ops who needs the system to suggest property/TCM.
3. Area owner for Koramangala/HSR.
4. Backlog cleaner handling old/duplicate leads.

TCM personas:

1. Field TCM with many same-day Tours.
2. High closer who should get hard leads.
3. New TCM needing scripts and property fit context.
4. Overloaded TCM who needs capacity protection.

HR personas:

1. Founder/leader checking revenue gap.
2. Team manager checking who is underperforming.
3. Supply-demand controller checking areas.
4. Quality reviewer checking leaks and lost reasons.

Owner personas:

1. Owner with ready inventory.
2. Owner blocking approvals.
3. Owner with low occupancy.
4. Owner needing confidence that Gharpayy is managing everything.

## 10. Technical implementation notes

Likely files/modules to update or add:

- `src/components/leads/QuickAddLeadPanel.tsx`
- `src/myt/pages/ScheduleTour.tsx`
- `src/myt/pages/MYTLeadTracker.tsx`
- `src/myt/pages/FlowOpsDashboard.tsx`
- `src/myt/pages/TCMDashboard.tsx`
- `src/myt/pages/WarRoom.tsx`
- owner pages under `src/owner/pages/*`
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` for “Tours” terminology and role navigation
- new shared inventory intelligence helper, for example `src/myt/lib/inventory-intelligence.ts`
- new pipeline page/route, for example `src/myt/pages/Pipeline.tsx` and `src/routes/myt/pipeline.tsx`
- coach logic in `src/lib/coach.ts`, `CoachInline`, and `CoachWidget`

Use current local stores/mock data first. No cloud/database tool is required for this pass.

## 11. Validation

After implementation:

- Run TypeScript/build validation.
- Test Quick Add paste → QuickAD fields → Supply Hub inventory match → duplicate → Tour scheduling.
- Verify Schedule Tour debug shows area detection, budget, available Supply Hub beds, lead distance, and captured map links.
- Test each role at mobile-ish viewport and desktop.
- Verify “Visits” is replaced with “Tours” in visible UI.
- Walk through the four-role persona checklist and confirm each role has goals, inventory context, and next actions.

### End-to-end Tours persona checklist

Validate the Tours flow like real users, not only as screens.

Flow Ops personas:

1. High-volume scheduler pastes copied lead data, sees parsed fields immediately, and schedules the best inventory-matched Tour without retyping.
2. New Flow Ops follows system recommendations for area, property, Flow Ops owner, and TCM.
3. Area owner checks their zone goal, matched inventory, lead queue, and daily Tours target.
4. Backlog cleaner finds a duplicate and uses the single “existing lead → Tour” decision path.

TCM personas:

1. Field TCM sees only their zone/Tours, property fit, slot, lead intent, and closing checklist.
2. High closer receives hard Tours and knows which property/room to pitch first.
3. New TCM gets objection prompts, room fit, budget fit, and why-this-property context.
4. Overloaded TCM sees capacity protection and reassignment signals instead of more unmanaged work.

HR personas:

1. Founder checks area demand, supply, Tours scheduled, closures, and revenue leakage.
2. Team manager compares Flow Ops scheduling output and TCM closing output.
3. Supply-demand controller sees areas with beds but low demand, and demand but too few Tours.
4. Quality reviewer checks duplicate handling, pipeline stage leaks, lost reasons, and owner blockers.

Property Owner personas:

1. Ready-inventory owner sees available beds and Tours generated from their rooms.
2. Blocking owner sees exact pending approvals/photos/pricing needed by the team.
3. Low-occupancy owner sees demand gaps and actions that unlock more Tours.
4. Trust-focused owner sees “Managed by Gharpayy” control: team is driving leads, Tours, and closures from their inventory.
